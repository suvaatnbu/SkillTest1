# Multi-Environment Dockerized Application

## Overview

This project demonstrates a multi-service application with separate Docker configurations for backend development, backend production, and frontend, orchestrated using Docker Compose. It supports smooth local deployment and inter-service communication.

## Infrastructure Setup

- Launch an EC2 instance with at least t2.micro or suitable specs (or use local machine).  
- Configure Security Groups to allow inbound traffic on ports:  
  - 3000 (frontend)  
  - 5000 (backend dev/prod depending on config)  
- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
````

* Network: Ensure the instance can communicate internally (default VPC allows this).

---

## Docker Configuration

### Backend Development Dockerfile (backend/dev/Dockerfile)

* Based on Python 3.9 slim
* Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
* Copies source files and `.env` for dev environment variables

### Backend Production Dockerfile (backend/prod/Dockerfile)

* Optimized for production
* May use a smaller base image or multi-stage build
* Copies only necessary files
* Loads production `.env`

### Frontend Dockerfile (frontend/Dockerfile)

* Based on node:18-alpine
* Installs npm dependencies from `package.json`
* Builds the frontend app
* Serves via lightweight server (e.g., `serve` or `nginx`)

### docker-compose.yml

* Defines services: backend-dev, backend-prod, frontend
* Maps ports (e.g., backend: 5000, frontend: 3000)
* Passes environment variables via `.env` files
* Sets up shared networks for inter-service communication

---

## Application Deployment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiEnv.git
   cd multiEnv
   ```

2. Build all Docker images:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. Start all services in detached mode:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Check running containers:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

5. Verify logs (optional):

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

6. Test frontend and backend connectivity as described below.

## Documentation & Testing

* **Deployment Steps:** As outlined in [Application Deployment](#application-deployment).
* **Testing Evidence:** (Attach screenshots here)

  * Docker containers running (`docker ps`)
  * Frontend UI accessible and functional
  * Backend API responding correctly via curl/Postman
* **Assumptions:**

  * Docker and Docker Compose are installed and operational
  * Required ports are open and not in use
  * Proper `.env` files configured in each service folder
  * Network allows inter-container communication
* **Access URLs and Ports:**

| Service            | URL                                  | Port | Description        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ---- | ------------------ |
| Frontend           | [http://localhost](http://localhost) | 3000 | User interface     |
| Backend (Dev/Prod) | [http://localhost](http://localhost) | 5000 | REST API endpoints |

---

## Access URLs and Ports

Use these URLs on your local machine or EC2 public IP/domain replacing `localhost`:

* Frontend UI: `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:3000`
* Backend API: `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:5000`

---

## Assumptions

* The environment supports Linux containers (for Windows/macOS, use Docker Desktop with WSL2)
* `.env` files contain correct environment variables (database URLs, secrets, etc.)
* No port conflicts exist
* Network security groups/firewalls allow access to exposed ports

---

## VIVA Preparation

* **Demonstrate:** Run `docker-compose up -d` and show healthy container status with `docker ps`.
* Open frontend in browser and navigate the app.
* Show backend API response using curl or Postman.
* Explain the purpose of each Dockerfile and service in `docker-compose.yml`.
* Discuss environment variables, port mapping, and network setup.
* Troubleshooting tips:

  * Check logs with `docker-compose logs <service>`
  * Rebuild images after code changes with `docker-compose build`
  * Modify ports in `docker-compose.yml` to avoid conflicts
* Possible modifications: scaling services, adding volumes, integrating CI/CD.

If you want, I can also help draft the example **Dockerfiles** or the **docker-compose.yml** based on your folder structure. Would you like me to do that next?
